# ToDo 
- Make README.md better

## Inspiration

A good TUI makes any terminal user happy. I was inspired to make a dashboard specifically for myself when looking at [DexUI](https://github.com/seenaburns/dex-ui). In the end, I hope for this project to allow me to teach myself how to use new tools in cyber security and elsewhere by attempting to abstract them into this dashboard.

## Purpose

To have a TUI dashboard that agregates many of the various scripts, statuses, and other commands that I usually have mutltiple terminals open to run.
